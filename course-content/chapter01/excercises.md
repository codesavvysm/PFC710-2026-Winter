## Exercise 1: Print Statements

Write a program that prints the following output:

```text
Hello, my name is [your name]
My favorite color is [color]
3 + 7 = [result of 3+7]
```

**Note:** Replace `[your name]`, `[color]`, and `[result of 3+7]` with actual values.

## Exercise 2: Error Identification

Execute each line below and notice the error that occurs. For each line, identify:
- What type of error it is (Syntax Error, Runtime Error, etc.)
- Why the error occurred
- How to fix it

```python
Print("Hello")
print("Hello)
print(10 / 2)
print("Result is", 10 / 0)
print("Hello World!")
```

**Hint:** Not all lines will produce errors. Pay attention to which ones do and which ones don't.
